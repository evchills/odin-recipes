        "Anything with a layer of mashed potatoes has to be good right? This hearty meal is full of beef 
        and vegetables. Perfect for a cozy winter's night."
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>2 lbs ground beef (or bison if you prefer)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion (diced)</li>
        <li>2-3 carrots (peeled and cut into small circles)</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>3-6 tbsp. tomato paste (I use 4)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of beef stock</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Worcestershire</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn (thawed)</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas (thawed)</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen green beans (thawed)</li>
        <li>3-4 cups of mashed potatoes (I make my own but you don't have to)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of grated parmesan</li>    
        <li>fresh parsley (for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a skillet over medium heat, add oil and ground beef and cook for 4-5 minutes while breaking into small crumbles.
            Transfer to a plate or bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            With the skillet still hot, add butter. Add onion, carrots, garlic, oregano, and half the salt. Cook for 8-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add tomato paste and cook for another 5-7 minutes. This really brings out the tomato flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the ground beef to the skillet and add Worcestershire, beef stock, and the remaining salt and pepper. 
            Let it simmer for a bit to combine everthing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the thawed corn, peas, and green beans and mix together to form a vegetable medley.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the beef mixture to a greased baking dish (or keep in skillet if you can put it in the oven) and form a uniform layer. 
            Add the vegetable medley as the second layer. Finally, add the mashed potatoes as the top layer and spread with a fork or 
            spoon to make even.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the fork to line the potatoes and add parmesan to the top. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until potatoes have a brown crisp. 
            Let cool for 5-10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot!
        </li>
    </ol>
