    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion (diced)</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk (diced)</li>
        <li>1 carrot (diced)</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>2 tsp. dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (28 oz.) can of Tuttorosso diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>5 cups of vegetable broth</li>
        <li>9-10 oz. cheese tortellini</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large pot on medium-low heat. Add carrot,
            celery, and onion. Once soft, add garlic, Italian herbs, and red
            pepper flakes if you want it spicy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in tomatoes, garlic powder, vegetable broth, salt and pepper.
            Cover pot and increase heat to medium. Once the broth comes to a boil, 
            simmer until carrots are fork tender (10-15 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add cheese tortellini and cook for a little less time than the package
            indicates (1-2 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat to low and add heavy cream and spinach. Let simmer until the
            spinach has wilted (2-3 minutes). Serve with parmesan and fresh basil.
        </li>
    </ol>
